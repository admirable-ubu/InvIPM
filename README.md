# Optimizing Image Segmentation in Metallic Objects Using Illumination-Invariant Transforms
In the case of metallic objects, the illumination will generate specular reflections and shadows, 
which must be minimized. This work proposes to apply illumination invariant transforms before image segmentation. As a case study, a set of input images with metallic parts is provided.

## InvIPM App description

InvIPM is MATLAB desktop application.
It allows to upload an image, to apply a set of illumination-invariant transforms, a series of clustering-based segmentation methods, and to assess the segmentation quality (if there is an image groundtruth).

## Description of repository folders

- **codeapp**  contains the code of the Matlab InvIPM desktop application. It also contains the sets of input images corresponding to metal pieces and their respective groundtruths.
- **experiment** results obtained with 4 illumination invariant algorithms, 4 segmentation algorithms based on clustering approaches, and 29 images with metal parts 
acquired by factory operators and manually segmented by researchers, 
show that the application of illumination invariant transforms significantly improves the image segmentation results.
